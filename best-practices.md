Best practice guides for different facets of software development.

The best practices described here were collected and honed by developers at
Palantir. Whether you're just starting a new project and wondering what tooling
to use, want to get better at giving code reviews, or are trying to improve your
test coverage, you can benefit from others who have done it before.
