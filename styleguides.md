Our style guides for a variety of languages.

Code is more often read than written.
Style guides exist to make reading code more pleasant and efficient by standardizing formatting.
Whether you follow our style guides precisely or use them as the basis for your own, you will find that using a style guide makes developing software in a team easier.
